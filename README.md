**FirebaseConfig.ts** configures the firebase database and authentication for the project  
  -It is currently using my keys, but we should probably make a separate account for the project

**user_data.ts** contains a function which queries the database for the specific user's data

**App.tsx** controls the navigation for both the outside and inside of app  

**app/screens** has a home, an info, and a login screen  
  -info and home needed to be added to

# Running the code
  -Will need npm and npx and expo  
  -Can probably find a tutorial to download it or it might be in the video above  
  -will also probably need to npm install some packages
